    <p>Testing Concepts</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of a structured testing environment?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Having a structured testing environment is about how the system does the tasks instead of how it works. By looking at the structure of the code and fully understanding what each part is supposed to do it helps catch errors, verify the flow, verify expected outputs and verify that each part of the code works as expected.</li>

<li>Identify and describe the main types of tests performed on software, including web applications?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Web app testing is comprised of:</li>
<ol>
<li>Functional Testing: which checks for invalid redirects, validation, workflow, data integrity. This test focuses on the functionality of the app.</li>
<li>Usability testing: Checks how easy/hard the application is to use.</li>
<li>Interface testing: checks the interface and dataflow from one system to another.</li>
<li>Compatibility testing: Checks for browser, operating system and device compatibility</li>
<li>Performance testing: Checks for server response time and load conditions. A subset of performance testing is, Load testing, stress testing, soak testing (checks system parameters under continuous expected load), and spike testing (checks whether the system will be able to sustain a work load in a sudden increase of users).</li>
<li>Security testing:&nbsp; checks to make sure the application is secured for the web against data theft.</li>

</ol>
<li>Software testing is comprised of:</li>
<ol>
<li>Sanity: tests for basic functionality</li>
<li>Smoke: tests for functionality of applications core features</li>
<li>Functional: thoroughly tests the functionality of a feature</li>
<li>Regression: tests older features to ensure changes haven&rsquo;t had an impact</li>
<li>Integration: tests the different parts of an app to make sure they are working in the way you expect.</li>
<li>Acceptance: testing requirements for the client</li>
<li>Unit: tests specific part of code to make sure it works correctly.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Which of these tests are most applicable for automated testing and web applications?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Automated testing is best used with regression tests. Web applications on the other hand go well with functional, usability, interface, compatibility, performance, and security testing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Testing Technologies</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of website testing?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>The purpose of website testing is to check that the application works as expected for different conditions.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>For automated testing in general how do these software tools work to test a website?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>They are usually testing against something to make sure they work as intended.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>What are the advantages of using testing software for web applications?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>By testing software applications a developer can cover all bases to ensure that the application will work at each step of the user process.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>What are some of the concerns or issues with using testing software for website applications?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>A lot of the concerns have to do with needing an experienced tester.</li>
<li>Another big issue is that when using a testing software you are bound to their software problems.</li>

</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Identify three of the main software tools,&nbsp;preferably open source,&nbsp;and who supports them?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Selenium: Industry professionals, and sponsors</li>
<li>Appium: JS foundation</li>
<li>Cucumber:&nbsp; industry professionals</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>How did this change your approach to testing your websites?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>I know a lot more now then I did a week ago. I will probably continue to look into testing and try to implement it on one of my projects so I can talk about it during portfolio day.</li>
